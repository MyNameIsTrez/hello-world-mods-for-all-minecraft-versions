# Context

These instructions are based on the YouTube video [Want to try Alpha? Watch this first.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wizn86AWJEc) by Mongster.

In the description of his video is the link to his Discord server, where you can ask for help. His server's `#alpha-1-1-2-01-instance-download` channel links [this MultiMC zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAtdkg6cOnBuIqcrZukYGmqaQpmwTTuO/view), which I've unzipped into this directory and trimmed down to the bare minimum.

The zip has some simple mods bundled with it, like adding charcoal to the game (which was added in Beta 1.2).

# Steps

1. [Download MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download).
2. Drag `Mongster's a1.1.2_01.zip` on top of MultiMC, and a `New Instance` window will pop up. Press `OK`.
3. Press the `Launch` button on the right side.
  - If you get the error `The java binary "" couldn't be found. Please fix the java path override in the instance's settings or disable it.` at the bottom of the log, go to `Settings`, and click `Auto-detect` under the `Java` tab. Press `OK`, and then `Launch` again.
4. Check that the game launches properly.
