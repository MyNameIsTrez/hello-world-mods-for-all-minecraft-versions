# "Hello, world!" mods for ***all*** Minecraft versions

The sole goal of this repository is to provides mods that print "Hello, world!", for ***all*** Minecraft versions, using as limited a number of frameworks as possible.

So because Minecraft Forge supports a wider range of Minecraft versions than the more modern Fabric, this repository won't provide any Fabric mods.

Instead of using Forge, I'll look into using NeoForge.

It seems like ModLoader is the only good framework for Alpha/Beta-era modding, while Forge/NeoForge covers every Minecraft version onwards.

Eventually I'll set up a CI that automatically checks that every mod prints "Hello, world!".
