# "Hello, world!" mods for ***all*** Minecraft versions

This repository provides mods that print "Hello, world!", for all Minecraft versions.

The sole goal of this repository is to cover the entire range of Minecraft versions, using as limited a number of frameworks as possible.

So because Minecraft Forge supports a wider range Minecraft versions than the more modern Fabric, this repository won't provide any Fabric mods.

Eventually I'll set up a CI that automatically checks that every mod prints "Hello, world!".
